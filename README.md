# Rad Args

A Go library for CLI arg parsing.

## ðŸš§ Under Development ðŸš§

Not yet ready for use.

## Overview

Existing libraries such as cobra, pflag are great, but are not quite flexible enough to meet the needs of
[rad](https://github.com/amterp/rad), and are missing crucial features. The goal of this Rad Args library is
to fulfill this role, in a reusable way, so that other projects may benefit as well.

More details to come.
